 ‚≠ê Star Type Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the **type of star** based on various stellar features such as temperature, luminosity, radius, and magnitude. The model uses **Logistic Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm, to classify stars into different categories based on their characteristics.

## üöÄ Project Overview
In astronomy, stars are categorized into different types based on their physical properties. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify stars based on input features like:

- **Temperature (K)**
- **Luminosity (L/Lo)**
- **Radius (R/Ro)**
- **Absolute Magnitude (Mv)**
- **Star Type (Class)**

The model is trained using **Logistic Regression**, which is suitable for binary and multiclass classification problems.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

| Feature              | Description                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temperature (K)**  | Surface temperature of the star in Kelvin.            |
| **Luminosity (L/Lo)**| Luminosity of the star relative to the Sun.           |
| **Radius (R/Ro)**    | Radius of the star relative to the Sun.               |
| **Absolute Magnitude (Mv)** | Intrinsic brightness of the star.               |
| **Star Type**        | Class of the star (e.g., Red Dwarf, White Dwarf, etc.)|

The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values and scale numerical features.

## üß± Model Used
The model is built using **Logistic Regression**, a widely-used algorithm for classification problems. Logistic Regression works by estimating the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular class using a sigmoid function.

The formula for logistic regression is given by:

\[
P(y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_n X_n)}}
\]

where:
- \( P(y=1|X) \) is the probability of the star being of a certain type.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept.
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n \) are the coefficients for each feature.
